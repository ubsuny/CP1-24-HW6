Module Name: preparation.py

This module provides tools for processing image data and performing frequency analysis using 2D FFT.
The primary use case involves handling image data from a periodic structure, allowing for tasks 
such as windowing, frequency shifting, and removing periodic patterns.

Module Contents:
    - Function to read pickle files with image data, returning a DataFrame with a 2D index based on 
        real-world dimensions.

Functions:
    - load_pickle_data: Reads in pickle files, loads the data and returns a DataFrame with 2D 
    indexing based on real-world dimensions.
